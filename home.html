        <h2>Google Home</h2>
        <p>The Google Assistant gained independence and garnered fame at the launch of the <em>Google Home</em>.
            In fact, for many people, this was the first time ever hearing of the Assistant. Of course,
            <em>Google Home</em> did more for the Assistant than simply giving it a <q>body.</q> It is a smart
            speaker designed to be a hub for all of your smart devices. At its release, the <em>Google Home</em>
            gave the user voice control over a limited number of devices like Philips Hue bulbs and Nest
            products; however, within a few months, it had control of over 5,000 devices. To make life even
            easier, Google implemented Routines. Once a Routine is established, a set list of actions can be
            triggered at a certain time or with a single command.</p>

        <p>The <em>Google Home</em> also works well with media as It can cast video to a TV using a Chromecast
            and play music and podcasts straight through its speakers. It supports popular services like
            YouTube, Netflix, Google Play, Spotify, and Pandora. However, its audio quality falls short of that
            of its main competitor, the Amazon Echo with the assistant Alexa.</p>
        <p>While the feature was missing at the release, the <em>Google Home</em> soon allowed for up to six
            Google accounts to be registered to one speaker using Voice Recognition. This means that there can
            be six <q>separate</q> assistants within one speaker so that each has its own voice and tailors its
            responses to its user, even remembering small details like the userâ€™s name and favorite animal.</p>
