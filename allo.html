        <h2>Google Allo</h2>
        <p>The Google Assistant was first introduced with Google’s release of the chat app <em>Allo</em>. The
            app came with a wide set of features that set it apart from a regular messaging app, but the most
            remarkable was the Assistant. You could chat with it directly in a separate conversation or summon
            it into any conversation by typing <q>@google</q> and a question. It would also appear on its own
            when it detected a need for information. For example, if someone mentions going out to eat, it might
            produce a small label that reads <q>Restaurants Nearby</q> which, when tapped, will prompt the AI to
            provide a list of restaurants and their related information. </p>

        <p>Google also made sure to add personality to <em>Allo’s new AI</em> by bringing in Google Doodle head
            Ryan Germick and ex-Pixar animator Emma Coats, who made it their goal to turn the Assistant into a
            character. They implemented humorous responses and made its speech more casual. When asked about
            Siri, the Assistant would speak of her as an old friend, implying it had some past.</p>
        <p><em>Allo’s Google Assistant</em> displayed many of the features today’s assistant is know for;
            however, there were some drawbacks. Its reminders, for example, could not sync with a Google account
            or calendar. Moreover, the advertised third-party integration was missing: Before <em>Allo’s</em> release,
            the company demonstrated the ability to make a reservation at a restaurant using OpenTable within
            the chat app, but the feature did not make it to the final product. Still, the software was a major step
            towards the future of Google Assistant.</p>
