        <h2>Google Now</h2>
        <p><em>Google Now</em> improved upon voice search by implementing the first traces of AI. It included a
            personalized feed beneath the search bar made up of cards. Over time, the program learned your
            habits and preferences and provided you with relevant information. For example, an avid football fan
            might see a card displaying the live score of their favorite team’s game. Additionally, it considers
            multiple factors, like appointment times and travel conditions, to create reminders. If any card is
            deemed irrelevant by the user, it can be easily dismissed with a swipe to the left or right or
            tapped to view more detailed information.</p>

        <p>Of course, being an update to Voice Search, <em>Google Now</em> came with a plethora of voice
            commands and features that began to shape it into the assistant we know today. While its predecessor
            could only display search results, <em>Google Now</em> could control functions of the phone, such as
            launching an app or calling a friend. It also responded to most prompts out loud so that the screen
            does not need to be in view. The last major improvement was the implementation of <em>Now on
                Tap</em>. This feature allowed <em>Google Now</em> to be accessed from within another app by
            tapping and holding the hold button or using the now famous wake word, “OK Google.” From within an
            app, the program looks at what you are doing and uses the context to decide what cards to display.
