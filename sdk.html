        <h2>Google Assistant SDK</h2>
        <p>By 2017, the Google Assistant had spread to Android phones and Android Wear smartwatches, but Google
            planned to develop its Assistant ecosystem beyond its products alone. The company soon released
            <em>the Google Assistant Software Development Kit (<abbr>SDK</abbr>)</em>, which accomplished its
            goal by allowing developers and tinkerers to add the Assistant to their hardware, ideally in
            Raspberry Pi prototypes.</p>

        <p>The <em>SDK</em> has two major working parts: a local Python application and the cloud-based Google
            Assistant Service. The Python application records the speech and sends it to the Assistant Service.
            The Service then analyzes the speech to determine the request and sends a response. Finally, the
            Python application analyzes the response and tells the hardware what to do. Because the <em>SDK</em>
            does not support the use of a wake word, this is usually initiated with the push of a button.</p>
        <p>Before its release, Google gave <a>Deeplocal</a> in Pittsburgh the chance to design one of the very
            first prototypes utilizing the <em>Google Assistant SDK</em>. They created a conversational, robotic
            mocktails mixer. The user pushes a button and makes a drink request, and the mixer will make small
            talk while it works on the drink. For example, it might ask you if you would like to hear about the
            weather. It is only a small sample of the potential of Google Assistant integration.</p>

        <p>Immediately after the release, large audio equipment manufacturers like JBL and LG jumped at the
            chance to add the Assistant to their products to create lines of smart speakers and headphones.
            Today almost every medium to high-end personal audio device lets the user easily access some virtual
            assistant.</p>
